Having a go at learning some VR coding with Godot

This is a simple 3D shooter.  It's very much a WIP and has been tested on an Oculus/Meta Quest 2.  

Controls are left controller thumbstick to move and either trigger to fire.

If you run on a windows PC without VR you can control with cursor keys and space bar to fire.

UPDATE: There's now homing missiles that will lock onto the nearest target (ish).  X button on controller
or C key on keyboard.
